- Feautures of VS CODE:

    1. Visual Studio Code CLI- Visual Studio Code comes with an inbuilt Command Line Interface.

    2. Git Integration- Sometimes using Git can be fun or hard, but Visual Studio Code comes with integrated Git that allows for Adding, Committing, Pulling and Pushing Changes to a remote Git repository using a simple GUI.

    3. Intellisense- Intellisense usually allows you to list members of a struct, class or object, and even get required parameters for functions, that makes writing code faster and less error prone. This is supported by default for JavaScript and TypeScript, but you may have to install language specific plugins to support the language you are using.

    4. Integrated Terminal-Most of the time when running code, there's usually a terminal open either to the side, or somewhere in your machine. Visual Studio Code comes with an Integrated Terminal accessible through View > Integrated Terminal, and configurable through the settings: "terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app",. The terminal usually opens by default in the workspace you are in, and can also have split views.

    5. Plugins and Themes-Visual Studio Code has a rich plugin API, and this has enabled developers to create really awesome plugins. You can look at the Visual Studio Code Marketplace to find plug-in's and Themes.

- Useful plug-in's of VS CODE: 

    1. Visual Studio Intellicode- Visual Studio Intellicode uses machine learning techniques to observe and find patterns used in numerous open-source GitHub projects, and it suggests them while you’re coding.

    2. Git Blame- Git Blame tells you who the last person that touched a line of code was. On top of that, you see which commit it happened in. This is very good information, especially when you’re working with something like feature branches. When using feature branches, you refer to a ticket with your branch name. Since Git Blame tells you which commit — thus which branch — a line of code was changed in, you know which ticket caused this change. This helps you get a better understanding of the reasoning behind the change.

    3. Prettier- It’s a compelling plugin that allows you to utilize the Prettier package. It’s a robust opinionated code formatter that allows developers to format their codes in a structured way. Prettier works together with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Markdown, GraphQL, and other modern tools and allows you to properly format your code.

    4. The JavaScript (ES6) code snippets- is a handy plugin that provides some very useful snippets of JavaScript codes for the idle developer. It binds standard JavaScript calls into simple hotkeys. Once you get the hang of it, it can increase your productivity dramatically.

    5. Debugger for Chrome- It is released by Microsoft, lets you debug your source files directly in Visual Studio Code.

    6. ESLint- The ESLint plugin integrates ESLint into Visual Studio Code. If you’re not familiar with it, ESLint is a tool that statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. Most problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are syntax-aware, and so you won’t experience errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms. And on top of that, ESLint is highly customizable.

    7. SVG Viewer- The SVG Viewer extension adds a number of utilities for working with SVGs in Visual Studio Code. This plugin makes it possible to render SVG files and see what they look like without having to leave the editor. Furthermore, this plugin also has options for converting to PNG and generating data URI schemes.

    8. Themes- There are tons of customization plugins that change the color scheme and the icons in the sidebar. Some popular themes that are available for free are One Monokai, One Dark Pro, and Material Icon.
