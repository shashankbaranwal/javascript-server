# MERN STACK 
##### Definition 
- MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack framework. It is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. It's comprises of 4 technologies namely : MongoDB , Express , React, Node.js.
- It is designed to make the development process smooter and easier. 
- Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.

##### Getting Started
- First, create a new project folder. Then go to the project folder in command prompt/terminal and type below command to initialize a package.json file. (Make sure npm is installed)
    > npm init
- After, this package.json file is created.

##### Getting to know MERN Stack components 
1. MongoDB: A document oriented , NO-SQL database used to store the application date.
2. Express : Node.js web framework.
3. React : a client-side JavaScript framework.
4. Node.js : The javascript runtime environment.It is used to run javascript on a machine rather than in a browser.

##### Is MERN a full-stack solution?
* Yes, MERN is a full-stack, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB).

##### Why choose the MERN stack?
-  MongoDB works extremely well with Node.js, and makes storing, manipulating, and representing JSON data at every tier of your application incredibly easy. For cloud-native applications, MongoDB Atlas makes it even easier, by giving you an auto-scaling MongoDB cluster on the cloud provider of your choice, as easy as a few button clicks.
- Express.js is a server-side application framework that wraps HTTP requests and responses, and makes it easy to map URLs to server-side functions. 
- React.js is a frontend JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces in HTML, and communicating with a remote server.
